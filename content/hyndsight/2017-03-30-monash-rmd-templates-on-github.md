Rmarkdown templates for staff and students in my department are now available on github. For a thesis, fork the repository [MonashThesis](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis).

For other templates, install the R package [MonashEBSTemplates R package](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashEBSTemplates). This provides templates for

   - beamer slides
   - working papers
   - exams
   - letters
