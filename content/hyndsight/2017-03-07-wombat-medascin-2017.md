Last year we had [WOMBAT (Workshop Organized by the Monash Business Analytics Team)](/hyndsight/wombat2016/) at the zoo, and [MeDaScIn (Melbourne Data Science Initiative)](/hyndsight/medascin2016/) in the city.

This year we are combining forces to hold [WOMBAT MeDaScIn 2017](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2017/).

There will be four days of tutorials (Monday 29 May to Thursday 1 June), and the main conference on Friday 2 June.
