Every year, the International Institute of Forecasters in conjunction with SAS offer some small grants to help promote research in forecasting. There are two $5000 grants per year for research on forecasting methodology and applications. This year, applications close on 30 September 2014. More details are given [here](http://forecasters.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/SAS-IIF-2014.pdf).

Information about past SAS-IIF awards is given on [the IIF website](https://forecasters.org/programs/funding-awards/research-awards/). It is interesting to see the range of topics covered. Here are the winning projects in the last two years:





  * Jeffrey Stonebraker: “Probabilistic Forecasting of the Global Demand for the Treatment of Hemophilia B.”


  * Yongchen (Herbert) Zhao: “Robust Real-Time Automated Forecast Combination in SAS: Development of a SAS Procedure and a Comprehensive Evaluation of Recently Developed Combination Methods.”


  * Zoe Theocharis, Nigel Harvey, Leonard Smith: “Improving judgmental input to hurricane forecasts in the insurance and reinsurance sector.”
