Earlier this week I had coffee with [Ben Fulcher](http://www.benfulcher.com) who told me about his [online collection](http://www.comp-engine.org/timeseries/) comprising about 30,000 time series, mostly medical series such as ECG measurements, meteorological series, birdsong, etc. There are some finance series, but not many other data from a business or economic context, although he does include my [Time Series Data Library](http://www.comp-engine.org/timeseries/time-series_data_source/source-37). In addition, he provides Matlab code to compute a large number of characteristics. Anyone wanting to test time series algorithms on a large collection of data should take a look.

Unfortunately there is no R code, and no R interface for downloading the data.
