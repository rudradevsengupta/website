We have two new continuing positions currently being advertised in our department: for lecturer and senior lecturer. Details are [on the Monash website](http://www.jobs-monash.jxt.net.au/academic-jobs/lecturer-senior-lecturer-econometrics-/481979). (For those in North America, a lecturer is equivalent to your assistant professor, and a senior lecturer is equivalent to your associate professor. See [the Wikipedia article on Australian academic ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_(Australia_and_New_Zealand)) for more information.)

Although the title says "Lecturer/Senior Lecturer (Econometrics)", we are interested in a wider range of candidates including statistics and machine learning. I'd particularly like to see strong candidates in computational statistics and machine learning, to add to our growing strength in this area.

Applications close on 20 January 2016. Please direct enquiries to [Professor Farshid Vahid](https://monash.edu/research/people/profiles/profile.html?sid=35633&pid=5204).
