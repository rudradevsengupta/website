This book was published in 1998, and for nearly 20 years I maintained an associated website at this address.

The data sets from the book can be found in the [**fma** package for R](http://cran.r-project.org/package=fma).

The solutions to exercises can be [downloaded here](/files/solutions.pdf).

The book is now out-of-date. I recommend my new book entitled [*Forecasting: principles and practice*](http://Otexts.org/fpp2/).
