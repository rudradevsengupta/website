title: Handling papers as an IJF associate editor
---

## Using ManuscriptCentral

When you log into [ManuscriptCentral](http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ijf) you will see an "Associate Editor Center" along with your "Reviewer Center" and "Author Center". These are for different roles that you have with the journal. You will mostly be using the "Associate Editor Center".

Please log in every week or two to check on papers you are handling and to handle any new papers you have been allocated. You will receive email notifications about new papers, but you won't necessarily receive any notifications about papers where the reviewers are overdue. So you need to keep on top of this and chase the reviewers where necessary.

Please resist the temptation to email reviewers outside the ManuscriptCentral system. It is much easier overall if all correspondence about a paper is handled via the site. That way, we can track everything and no paper will fall through the cracks. You can usually email someone about a paper by clicking on their name when viewing the paper details.

## Your preferred topics

All associate editors and their preferred topics are listed at [http://goo.gl/ZGLp68](http://goo.gl/ZGLp68). The editors often look at this list when selecting an AE, so please make sure your topics are up-to-date and detailed. Feel free to also list topics you do *not* want to handle.

## New papers to handle

You will be sent new papers to handle by one of the six editors (Dilek Onkal, Dick van Dijk, Esther Ruiz, Mike McCracken, George Kapetanios, and me). The editor who sends you the paper is responsible for making the final decision on it. You are responsible for providing a recommendation, and for organizing reviewer reports if necessary.

If you do not think the paper is worthy of review, then please just write a short report yourself explaining why.

The only papers that reviewers should see are those that an Editor and an AE both think is worth a more thorough read by someone. This system both protects our reviewers (so that they are more available when we really need them) and it is good for authors -- better a quick rejection than a painfully slow one.

## Choosing reviewers

If you decide the paper is worthy of review, you will need to find two reviewers.

It is a good idea to invite three reviewers initially as usually at least one of them will decline. Check back every week until you have at least two people who have *agreed* to provide reviews.

The authors may have made some suggestions about reviewers. We try to use at least one of the author's suggestions, but only if they are appropriate. I suggest you do not use a reviewer in the same department as the author, or a reviewer who has been a coauthor of the author, or a student of the author, as they are less likely to provide an impartial perspective on the submission.

A good way to find reviewers is to look at the recent cited papers in the bibliography, or to do a search on Google Scholar for recent papers on the same topic. But remember that reviewers are more likely to agree if they know you.

Once you have at least two reviewers who have agreed, you can generally relax for a few weeks. But please actively chase up reviewers if they have taken more than 3 months. The ManuscriptCentral system will automatically send some reminder letters, but then it will simply do nothing if they don't respond. So after the automated reminders, if there is still no response, please take some action yourself. (You can see when reminders have been sent by checking the Audit tab.)

If you simply cannot find two reviewers, or the reviewers you have chosen do not deliver, then you may have to write one of the reports yourself.

In general, we aim to get a first response back to the author inside 3 months.

## Provide a recommendation

There are five recommendation categories:

* accept: that means no further revisions are possible. Only choose this when you are completely satisfied with the paper.
* minor revision: this is for papers where some small changes are required, which should only take the authors a few weeks at most. You would not normally send a paper back to the reviewers for the next version after a minor revision decision.
* major revision: this is for papers which will go back to the same reviewers for another look.
* reject and resubmit: the next version of the paper will be handled as a new submission and will not necessarily go back to the same reviewers (although it would be best to go to the same AE if possible). This is for papers where the revisions are too substantial for a "major revision" decision, but you think there is enough merit in the paper not to reject it.
* reject: the paper is rejected, and no revision of it is allowed to be submitted to the IJF.

It is helpful if you provide at least a few sentences explaining your recommendation to the editor, especially if the two reviewers disagree.

Do not feel obliged to follow the reviewers in making your recommendation. If you think they have missed something important, please say so in your note to the editor.

Our impact factor has been around 1.6 for the last few years. That is, each paper is cited an average of about 1.6 times in the first two years after publication. If you think a paper is unlikely to receive at least one or two citations in the first couple of years, then it is probably not of sufficient quality for the IJF.

We publish about 80 papers per year, and receive about 500 submissions per year. So the acceptance rate is about 16% (although the acceptance rate of papers that reach AEs is much higher -- around 30-40%). If in doubt, recommend reject.

## Things to look for in papers where you recommend acceptance or revision

* Make sure the figures are of good quality (high enough resolution to be reproduced in the journal), axes labelled, etc. Color figures are ok. At proof stage, we insert a comment in the caption saying "See the online version of this paper for the color figures" or something like that.
* Don't worry about minor English problems as they are fixed by my copyeditor. However, if the English is very bad, please ask them to seek the help of an English editor before accepting the paper. Elsevier provide such a service (for a fee): [http://webshop.elsevier.com/languageservices/languageediting/](http://webshop.elsevier.com/languageservices/languageediting/)
* Don't worry about formatting, bibliography style, etc. My copyeditor will fix this up.
* We can have online supplements to papers that are attached to the paper on sciencedirect. So if the paper is too long, or has too many tables, figures, etc., please suggest this option to the author. The online supplements can be submitted with the paper as supplementary files.
* We do not have a maximum or minimum number of pages per paper, but try to keep papers as short as possible given the number of ideas they contain. I don't mind very short research notes (e.g., 2 pages) provided they say something useful and you think they are likely to be cited.
