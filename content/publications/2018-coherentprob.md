Forecast reconciliation involves adjusting forecasts to ensure coherence with aggregation constraints.
We extend this concept from point forecasts to probabilistic forecasts by redefining
forecast reconciliation in terms of linear functions in general, and projections more specifically.
New theorems establish that the true predictive distribution can be recovered in the elliptical
case by linear reconciliation, and general conditions are derived for when this is a projection. A
geometric interpretation is also used to prove two new theoretical results for point forecasting;
that reconciliation via projection both preserves unbiasedness and dominates unreconciled
forecasts in a mean squared error sense. Strategies for forecast evaluation based on scoring rules
are discussed, and it is shown that the popular log score is an improper scoring rule with respect
to the class of unreconciled forecasts when the true predictive distribution coheres with aggregation
constraints. Finally, evidence from a simulation study shows that reconciliation based
on an oblique projection, derived from the MinT method of [Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos
& Hyndman (2018)](/publications/mint) for point forecasting, outperforms both reconciled and unreconciled
alternatives.
