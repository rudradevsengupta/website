> I am currently working as a Scientist in the Scientific Computing Group in Janssen: Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and is based in Beerse, Belgium. I finished my Ph.D. from [Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat)](https://ibiostat.be/) the  supervision of [Professor Ziv Shkedy](https://www.uhasselt.be/fiche?email=ziv.shkedy).

My primary field of research is statistical bioinformatics. I am more interested in application of statistical models and currently working on Microbiome data. I am also interested in the computational aspects of statistical models, data science, machine learning techniques and application of statistics in sports.
Previously, I studied at the Indian Statistical Institute, where I completed my Bachelor's degree (in 2011), and Master's degree (in 2013) in Statistics.
