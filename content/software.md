## Functional data and demography packages

* [**addb**](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/addb/):  Nine data sets, taken from the Australian Demographic Data Bank version 3.2b, courtesy of [Len Smith](mailto:leonard.smith@anu.edu.au).

* [**demography**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/demography): Provides a large number of functions for handling demographic statistics, modelling and forecasting. In particular, it implements lifetable calculations; Lee-Carter modelling and variants; functional data analysis of mortality rates, fertility rates, net migration numbers; and stochastic population forecasting. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=demography)]

* [**fds**](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=fds): Functional data sets useful for testing new methods. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=fds)]

* [**smoothAPC**](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=smoothAPC): Smoothing demographic data with period and cohort effects. The method uses bivariate thin plate splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors. The methods are described in [Dokumentov & Hyndman (2014) Bivariate data with ridges: two-dimensional smoothing of mortality rates](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mortality-smoothing/). [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=smoothAPC)]

Data from the 2013 and 2016 Australian Federal Elections and the 2011 and 2016 Australian Censuses for each House of Representatives electorate, along with some tools for visualizing and analysing the data. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=eechidna)]

* [**emma**](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=emma/): The evolutionary model-based multiresponse approach (EMMA) is a novel methodology to process optimisation and product improvement. The approach is suitable to contexts in which the experimental cost and/or time limit the number of implementable trials. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=emma)]

* [**hdrcde**](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/hdrcde/): Tools for the computation of highest density regions in one and two dimensions, kernel estimation of univariate density functions conditional on one covariate, and multimodal regression. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=hdrcde)]

* [**MEFM**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/mefm-package): A set of tools for implementing the Monash Electricity Forecasting Model based on the paper by [Hyndman and Fan (2010)](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/peak-electricity-demand/).
